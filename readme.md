This is a simple Python/Django application that was developed as a proficiency exam. 

The full stack application was developed per wireframe requirements to demonstrate profiency in Django using MVC architecture, user password encryption, stateful web service, RESTful routing, CRUD operations, API creation, relational data modeling using sql, validation and error messaging to maintain database integrity, ORM queries to render data to view, and proficiency scripting logic to provide user features.

This exercise was completed within the allotted four hours without the use of any boilerplate code.

Django version 1.10
Python version 2.7

Walkthrough: 

User login/registration:

1. User name in top right indicates successful user authentication
2. "Popular Quotes!" shows all quotes in database, minus user favorites which appear on right side. Quotes are dynamically added and subtracted accordingly.
3. All CRUD operations are accessible through addition of new quotes, show of user profile, update of list preferences, and deletion of quote altogether. 
4. Statefulness is applied using user ID upon creation/login and is persistent until user logs out. 


Database user table data:

View of database table confirms successful encryption of user passwords.
